# Sudokus

Simple logic project to improve my computational thinking. I have two phases:
<ul>
  <li> [x] Sudoku Validator, we have an outputted sudoku, we check if lines, columns and subcells are correct. </li>
  <li> [x] Sudoku Solver, currently in progress</li>
</ul>

Now i want to make a Flask Web App that will:
<ul>
  <li>Grab an input from a user that don't know Python</li>
  <li>Solve it live with Python magic</li>
  <li>Stock already solved sudokus</li>
<ul>

### Layout of Web app at the 22/09

Each cell is a text input, i thought it will be more easy for the user and for me.

### Managing to retrieve each cell input
