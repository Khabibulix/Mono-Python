# Book_Gen

<h2> DevLog </h2>
I'm currently working on making a GUI for this project using TKinter, I commented all my good code to make it user-friendly, then I'll add it all. Currently, this code, if uncommented, generates a random book and redirects us to chasse-de-livres.com which is a site that compares prices from the random book that I put in input.
<br>
GUI is almost done, i'll need to fix some issues and to document my functions and it'll be ready to publish i think in less than a week, we're the 22/07 when i post this.
<br>
We are the 26/07, project is finished, i'm going to move on.

<h2> Differents versions:</h2>
V1: Providing a simple book generator to help me choosing the next book that i'll read based on my humor. Programmatically, it is POO friendly, i could have provided a TDD Development Strategy but i found that is overloaded for a project that simple
V2: Removing mood feature and finishig project

<h2> Future improvements:</h2>
