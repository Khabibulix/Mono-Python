<p>I want to make one project to rule them all.
  The goal here is to make an app that will help me to manage my forever growing library</p>
  
My plan at the 31/05/2023: <br>
<ul>
  <li>Make a really simple console app</li>
  <li>Make a GUI to make it easier, perhaps with Tkinter, as i already know that</li>
  <li>Connect it to a database using an API</li>
  <li>Adding backend to share library</li>
  <li>Go cloud?</li>
</ul>

I don't know yet how I will do it, but i'm on my way. I'll be using Python for this project, don't know if that's possible but i'll make my best.
