# BookWorm

<p>I want to make one project to rule them all. The goal here is to make an app that will help me to manage my forever growing library</p>
  
My plan at the 31/05/2023: <br>
<pre>
  - [x] Make a really simple console app
  - [x] Make a I/O working app
  - [x] Make a GUI to make it easier, perhaps with Tkinter, as i already know that
  - [] Connect it to a database using an API
  - [] Adding backend to share library
</pre>

For this project i'll be using Python, Tkinter and Django.

For more informations about how i made it and what could be improved, please see my wiki here: <br>
