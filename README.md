# Mono-Python

Here is my mono-repository for the Python language, i learn it since april 2022 and from time to time, the code inside the folders are not from the same period of time, that's why the code's quality may vary. The first project i made which is inside this repo is <em> Calculator </em> and the last <em> Sudokus </em> if you want to compare.

The two biggest projects are <em>Sudokus</em> and <em>Pong</em>. The last one is the one I am the most proud of.
