# Website_blocker

<h5>Browser web site blocker for Windows</h5>
The goal of this project is to block different websites provided by the user in IP Address or in domain names.

<h3>Mandatory setup</h3>
In Blocker.py there is a variable named host_file_path, you'll need to change mine and put yours. In general, for<strong> Windows </strong> the path is c:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts. If you use it on Linux and encounter an issue, please post it in Issues.

<h3>Precisions</h3>
When you close the program, the hosts file is reverted to its original state, however i humbly suggest to copy first your hosts file, to be safe.
